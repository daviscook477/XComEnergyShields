XCom Energy Shields

Have you ever been extremely annoyed by the Advent Shieldbearer's and their damn energy shields! Well, sorrow no longer because now you can have energy shields too! 

This mod adds two different equip-able items and a grenade to allow XCom to use the same shield generation technology as Advent: A Group Shield Generator, a Personal Shield Generator, and a Energy Shield Grenade. 

The Group Shield Generator provides a 2HP shield that lasts for 6 turns to all nearby allies when utilized and has two charges. 
The Personal Shield Generator provides a 4HP shield that lasts for 6 turns to only its bearer but has three charges. 
The Energy Shield Grenade provides a 3HP shield that lasts for 6 turns but is a grenade and may be throw or launched to reach far away targets. 

In order to access the Energy Shield Generators and Grenades, you'll need to have completed the Advent Shieldbearer autopsy. Then with some supplies and elerium, you can give those Advent Shieldbearers a taste of their own medicine. 

The Personal Shield Generator and the Group Shield Generator are both obtained through a repeatable foundry project that unlocks after completing the autopsy. They each cost 60 supplies, 10 elerium, and 1 elerium core to make. 

The Personal Shield Generator is a utility item able to be equipped by any soldier. 
The Group Shield Generator is a heavy weapon item, only able to be equipped using the WAR Suit or other armor capable of mounting heavy weapons. 

The Grenades are simply built in engineering and cost 60 supplies, 10 elerium, and 2 Advent Shieldbearer corpses. 

Right now I'm having trouble with the animations, so it doesn't look as spectacular as it could. But I'm seeing what I can do. 

COMPATIBILITY NOTES: 

This mod should be compatible with all other mods because it does not make any modifications to base game files, only additions.
